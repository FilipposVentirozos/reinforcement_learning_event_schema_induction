# Reinforcement Learning for Event Schema Induction
Work in reinforcement learning under process.

The project aims to use Reiforcement Learning (RL) for event schema induction. 

It is purposed for a meta-learning RL objective, where it first learns to extract the named entities and then which named entities are combined together to form an event.
