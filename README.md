# Reinforcement Learning for Event Schema Induction
Work in reinforcement learning under process.

The project aims to use Reiforcement Learning (RL) for event schema induction. 

It is purposed for a meta-learning RL objective, where it first learns to extract the named entities and then which named entities are combined together to form an event. 

The idea resides in having mutlitple agents traverse the tokens in a zig-zag pattern to learn which named-entities together form an event.
