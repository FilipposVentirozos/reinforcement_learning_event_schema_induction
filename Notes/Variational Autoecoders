How to concatenate?
    - Per Lexical Units, similar to the Hierarchical ... (2018) which uses verb, object, ...
        - I was thinking to have orthogonal axis for each NE type
        - How to concatenate with multiple types of one type? (like many ingredients)
            -
    - Use Hypernyms
        - Choose the level with exploratory analysis
            - not too much, not too little
